Build instructions for GPLPV drivers
------------------------------------

This is a patchset against James Harper's PV drivers for Windows NT Xen guests. See http://wiki.xensource.com/xenwiki/XenWindowsGplPv. This patch applies cleanly against at least http://xenbits.xensource.com/ext/win-pvdrivers.hg changeset 706.

1. hg-fetch from the GPLPV sources above.
2. Apply gplpv_kernel/gplpv-kernel.patch in subdirectory xenpci/
3. Add files gplpv_kernel/evtchn/evtchn_device_interface.c and gntmem_device_interface.c in xenpci/
4. Add both those files to the 'sources' list
5. Build as indicated in James' documentation

Building GPLPV userspace DLLs
-----------------------------

For each subdirectory of gplpv_userspace except 'include', build as follows:

1. Make a trivial Visual Studio project (or use cl.exe and link.exe directly)
2. Build the .c files into a DLL using the .def file to define its exports (set the Resource Definition file property or use the /DEF: switch).
3. Be sure to supply as include paths gplpv_userspace/include, gplpv_kernel/include and (GPLPV root)/include and (GPLPV root)/include/public.

This should generate a load of DLLs in out\(arch)\release\bin\additions.

Installation should be as for the normal GPLPV drivers.
